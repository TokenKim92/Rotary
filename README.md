# Rotary

This project was implemented to show how a single page application (SPA) works with animation effects in HTML5. I use all my HTML5 projects as cover for each portfolio.

Click on a portfolio cover to view the project directly on the same page.

This project was inspired by YouTuber `Interactive Developer`, but all architecture and code was implemented by me.
